# CFS-Scheduler-Simulation
A C++ simulation of the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS), inspired by the Linux kernelâ€™s process scheduling algorithm. This project demonstrates how CFS manages CPU-bound and IO-bound processes using virtual runtime and fair queuing.

=> Features :
1. Simulates both CPU-bound and IO-bound processes

2. Priority queue-based scheduling using process virtual runtime (vruntime)

3. Adjustable process priorities and burst times

4. Detailed logging of process execution slices, including start/end times and durations

5. Neatly formatted console output for process info and execution logs

=> Demo Output :
